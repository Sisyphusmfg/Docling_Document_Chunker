# requirements.txt for Docling Conversation Chunker v53

# Core document processing
docling>=1.0.0
chardet>=3.0.0

# Optional GPU acceleration (for PyTorch detection in main())
# Uncomment if you want GPU support for potential future ML features
torch>=1.9.0

# Standard library modules (DO NOT include these - they're built into Python):
# - argparse (built-in)
# - json (built-in)
# - logging (built-in)
# - re (built-in)
# - uuid (built-in)
# - dataclasses (built-in since Python 3.7)
# - datetime (built-in)
# - enum (built-in)
# - pathlib (built-in since Python 3.4)
# - typing (built-in since Python 3.5)
# - sys (built-in)

# Note: This code appears to be self-contained and only requires:
# 1. Python 3.7+ (for dataclasses and other modern features)
# 2. Docling for document parsing
# 3. Optional PyTorch for GPU detection

# If you plan to extend functionality, consider these optional packages:
pandas>=1.3.0          # For data manipulation
numpy>=1.20.0          # For numerical operations
# google-api-python-client>=2.0.0  # For Google Docs API
# google-auth-httplib2>=0.1.0       # For Google API auth
# google-auth-oauthlib>=0.5.0       # For Google OAuth
# google-auth>=2.0.0                # For Google authentication
